                  For people who don't know the fundamental difference between
                  the two conventional, thermal cars(ICE) and electric cars is
                  the process of transforming the potential energy into kinetic
                  energy.( Better review your elementary notes now, basically
                  fancy names for stored energy vs movement ) In internal
                  combustion engined powered cars this energy is stored in a
                  chemical form and is released through a chemical reaction
                  inside the engine( mixing of air and fuel, with a spark ).
                  Once again, a law we learned in elementary school, the
                  conservation of matter says that in chemical reactions, the
                  total mass of the product must equal the total mass of the
                  reactants. This law is a very important concept I will touch
                  on later, but basically whatever we are burning will have to
                  get released back into the the environment somehow.( by gas
                  form in this case) On the other hand, electric cars work
                  differently, It stores chemical energy and releases the energy
                  electrochemically, this means that there is no fuel being
                  burned(chemical reaction) therefore no air pollutants through
                  C02 while driving.

                  Because electric cars are so new their reliability is abysmal, compared to well established companies such as Lexus who ranks high year after year. There are numerous people reporting that their lexus/toyota(same company) have reached over 1 million miles. Tesla‚Äôs batteries are only designed to last 300,000 miles ‚ÄúCurrent battery modules should last 300k...‚Äù says elon musk on twitter.

                  People who support electric cars argue that EVs can produce zero tailpipe emissions, even when using fossil fuels to charge EVs contribute fewer emissions than ICE cars, ICE vehicles pollute continuously, and EV manufacturers use eco friendly materials.Any manufacturer can start using eco friendly materials when making a car so that point is null. Although they do not emit C02 while being driven, they do it in 3 other stages: during manufacturing, energy production , and at the end of the life cycle. The mining activities needed to extract the rare earth metals used in the batteries are very energy consuming and polluting. If the energy production is being powered with energy from burning fossil fuels, it is still releasing c02 in the power plant. When it comes to dealing with the batteries being recycled it is still expensive and most batteries are not being recycled.

              So what do we do with the problem of global warming, we can't do nothing about it, right? One solution that would help the problem is simply purchasing smarter and more reliable brands. Stop buying Land Rovers, Bmw‚Äôs, and other car companies that are known to barely survive past their two year lease cycle/ 100,000 miles. Instead buy cars that are known to easily hit 300,000 miles, some brands such as lexus even having many owners hit 1 million miles with just basic maintenance. By doing this we conserve the matter needed to build cars, even though they may not be the fastest, or most technologically advanced cars. Another solution is to build on something that is close to becoming feasible, and does not include rebuilding our whole infrastructure. Porsche, along with Mazda, are one of the leaders in the efuel alliance who are developing a renewable, eco-friendly synthetic fuel. The way the fuel works is by the law of conservation of matter, the fuel actually uses the C02 in the air to produce the fuel, meaning when the engine burns it, it would be carbon neutral. The idea is that synthetic fuels will get to the point that you will be able to run them on any engine, and since we already have fueling stations all over the country there would not be a need to build any infrastructure to support it.
              
              As of right now most engines can run the synthetic fuel with a little modification of the fuel lines or a mixture of synthetic and fossil fuel. Keeping the solution as simple as possible.            </p>
